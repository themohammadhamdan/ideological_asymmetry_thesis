# Ideological Asymmetry (Master thesis): Political ideology predicts individual variations in neural dynamics when watching non-political movies
This repo includes all scripts and `.csv` files that I used to analyse the ID1000 dataset of the AOMIC databases for my thesis on ideological asymmtery. These Jupyter notebooks have detailed commentary on all stages my analysis from data wrangling to analysis and visualisation.

The scripts are numbered in order of use, and are all located in the scripts folder.
In the csv_files folder you can find all `.csv.` files (and one `.RData` file) which include the socio-demographic data of our participants. `data_whole.RData` and `participants.csv` were used to create `all_data.csv` in the `Matching Data` script. This was then divided into `exploratory_half.csv` and `confirmatory_half.csv` in the `Splitting Data` script.

For more details, please refer to the accompanying report.
